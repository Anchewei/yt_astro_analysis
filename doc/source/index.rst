Welcome to yt_astro_analysis's documentation!
=============================================

These semi-autonomous analysis modules are unique to specific subject matter
like tracking halos, generating synthetic observations, exporting output to
external visualization routines, and more.  Because they are somewhat
specialized, they exist in their own corners of yt, and they do not get loaded
by default when you "import yt".  Read up on these advanced tools below.
